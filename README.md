=========================

This project was created as a final project for a data structures course in the fall of 2013. The game visualizes a binary search tree created from random values, but missing the values of the nodes. A shuffled list of the nodes is given and the player must fill in the values of the binary tree to complete the game. Easy, medium, and hard difficulties are available and alter the size and depth of the tree.

You can download the JAR file associated with this project [here](http://raw.github.com/bjcrawford/BST-Puzzle/master/BC_BST-Puzzle.jar) or you can compile the project yourself.

This project makes use of SimpleGUI, a library which provides simplified access to Java graphics and GUI input. SimpleGUI was created by [Rolf Lakaemper](http://www.temple.edu/cis/directory/tenure/lakaemper.html), a professor at Temple University.
